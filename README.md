# Project Duke

Project Duke is a educational software project designed to take you through the steps of building a small software incrementally, while applying as many Java and SE techniques as possible along the way.

The project aims to build a product named Duke, a Personal Assistant Chatbot that helps a person to keep track of various things. The name Duke was chosen as a placeholder name, in honor of Duke, the Java Mascot. You may give it any other name and personality you wish.

Here is a table containing the command words and a brief description:

Command | description
------------ | -------------
[todo](#todo-command) | adds a task to be completed
[event](#event-command) | adds an event + location 
[deadline](#deadline-command) | adds a deadline + date + time
[list](#list-command) | allows user to see a list of all commitments
[find](#find-command) | allows user to filter commitments by a keyword
[delete](#delete-command) | allows user to remove a task from the list
[done](#done-command) | mark a task as complete
[bye](#close-duke-command) | close Duke

On startup, the user will be greeted by the following message:
