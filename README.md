#### 1. Add Todo

Format : `todo {description of task}`

Examples:
   * `todo Read Book`
   * `todo Excersise`
#### 2. Add Event 
   Format: `event {description of event} /at {time event is at}`

*Note: Entering the time of event in `dd/MM/yyyy HHmm` will enable Duke to perform `agenda` operation on those events*

Examples:
   * `event Lecture /at 25/9/2021 2030` _-- Duke will be able to use agenda on this event_
   * `event Lecture /at Today 2pm`      _-- Duke simply stores 'Today 2pm' as a String and this event does not show up in the agenda_

#### 3. Add Deadline
Format: `deadline {description of deadline} /by {time deadline is due by}`

*Note: Entering the time of deadline in `dd/MM/yyyy HHmm` will enable Duke to perform `agenda` operation on those events*

Examples:
   * `deadline Assignment /by 25/9/2021 2030` _-- Duke will be able to use agenda on this deadline_
   * `deadline Assignment /by today 8:30pm` _-- Duke simply stores 'today 8:30pm' as a String and this deadline does not show up in the agenda_

#### 4. List all tasks - View all tasks you have added
Format: `List`

#### 5. View Agenda - View all events/deadlines that are at/due today
Format: `agenda`

*Note: This functions only shows events/deadlines whose times were entered in the 'dd/MM/yyyy HHmm' format*

#### 6. Find Task - find a task by searching for a keyword
Format: `find {query}`

Examples:
* `find Book`
* `find Assignment`
* `find Lecture`

#### 7. Set task as done 
Format: `done {index of task done}`

*Note: the index is the index of the task when you enter `list`*

Example interaction:
```text
User: list
Duke : 
____________________________________________________________
1.[E][ ] Lecture (at: today 8pm)
2.[T][ ] Something
3.[D][ ] assignment (by: today 2359)
____________________________________________________________
User: done 1
Duke:
 ____________________________________________________________
Good Job!! I've marked this task as done:
[E][X] Lecture (at: today 8pm)
____________________________________________________________
User: list
Duke: 
____________________________________________________________
1.[E][X] Lecture (at: today 8pm)
2.[T][ ] Something
3.[D][ ] assignment (by: today 2359)
____________________________________________________________
```

#### 8. Delete a task
