## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `jarvis.jar` from [here](https://github.com/ashrafjfr/ip/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for **Jarvis**.

1. Open your desired _Command Line Interface_ from the folder with `jarvis.jar` and enter the following code: `java -jar jarvis.jar`

1. Type a command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:
    * **`todo read book`** : Adds a `read book` task to your list of tasks.

    * **`deadline return book /by 01/11/2021 1800`** : Adds a `return book` **deadline** task with a **specific date and time** to your list of tasks.*

    * **`event attend CS2113T lecture /at 30/10/2021 1600`** : Adds an `attend CS2113T lecture` **event** task with a **specific date and time** to your list of tasks.*

    * **`list`** : Lists all tasks.

    * **`done 1`** : Marks the 1st task in the current list as done.

    * **`delete 2`** : Deletes the 2nd task in the current list.

    * **`bye`** : Exits the app.

      ***Note:** date and time must be entered in either of these formats **`DD/MM/YYYY hhmm`** or **`DD-MM-YYYY hhmm`** <br>
      where **`D: Date, M: Month, Y: Year, h: Hour, m: Minute`** and time must be in **`24-hour notation`**.

## Features

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `todo DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `todo read book`.

* Parameters have to be in correct order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `deadline DESCRIPTION /by DATE TIME`, the order of command and parameters have to be followed.

* Parameters have to be in correct format.<br>
  e.g. for date and time, it must be entered in either of these formats **`DD/MM/YYYY hhmm`** or **`DD-MM-YYYY hhmm`** <br>
  where **`D: Date, M: Month, Y: Year, h: Hour, m: Minute`** and time must be in **`24-hour notation`**.

* Parameters have to be the correct type (such as `done` and `delete` must be followed by an integer).<br>
  e.g. in `done 2`, `2` has to be an integer character, `two` will not be recognised.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list` and `bye`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be not be recognised and you will have to input your `list` command again.
