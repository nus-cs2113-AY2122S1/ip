#Todo List <br> for improvements in the future

---
- [x] `done`, `delete`, `deadline`, and `event` commands not working 
with 1 or more whitespace (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException)

- [ ] More abstraction

- [ ] Need more S L A P P in methods

- [x] `todo` + empty space generates task with whitespace as taskName

- [x] `engageUser()` to handle parsing then commands, separately

- [x] If load file is blank, no message on whether file was loaded 
    successfully or not

- [ ] Consider which methods to be `public` or `private`
