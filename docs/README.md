### Save File

#### Automatic saving

The tasks in the managed task list will automatically be saved to a file `tasks.txt` in the current directory after each addition, deletion or completion of a task.

#### Editing the save file

The save file `tasks.txt` can be modified such that the modified task information will be imported into the program when it is next run.

Each line in a single task and the pipe `|` character is used to separate task information.

The format for each type of task is as follows:

Todo: `<type>|<completion_status>|<description>`

E.g. `T|0|buy milk`

Deadline and Event: `<type>|<completion_status>|<description>|<date>`

E.g. Deadline: `D|0|movie night|2021-10-10`

E.g. Event: `E|0|movie night|2021-10-11`

> üí° `<completion_status>` must be either `0` for incompete or `1` for completed.
> 
> üí° `<event_date>` must be entered in the format of `YYYY-MM-DD`.
> 
> ‚ùó If the save file is corrupted or does not follow the save format, the task information will not be loaded and the file will be overwritten.

### FAQ

---

**Question**: What if I do not have a save file.  
**Answer**: A new save file will be created upon adding or deleting a task, or when marking a task as done.

**Question**: Can I transfer the save file to a different computer?
**Answer**: Yes.
1. Follow the instructions in the [Quick Start](#quick-start) to obtain a copy of `hal.jar` on the target computer.
2. Transfer the existing `tasks.txt` from the source computer to the target computer. Place `tasks.txt` in the same directory as `hal.jar`.
