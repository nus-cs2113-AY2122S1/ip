**Notes about the command format:**
* Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
e.g. in `todo DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `todo read book`.
* For commands that do not take in parameters, supplying a parameter will result in an error.
e.g. entering `list 3` will result in an error.
