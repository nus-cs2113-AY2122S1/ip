### Notes about Command Format:
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
* If a command expects parameters, then the user has to key it in the correct order and only once.
* If a command (`list` and `bye`) does not expect any parameters, it will be ignored.

## Data Storage in `duke.txt`

Duke automatically saves all the tasks to a text file after each command which modifies the task list.
This means the users can recover their tasks even after relaunching `Duke`.

### Editing `duke.txt`

It's highly advisable that beginner users do not edit any part of this file as if the data is not stored in the 
required format it might cause `Duke` to crash.
