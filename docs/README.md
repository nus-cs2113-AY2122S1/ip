	____________________________________________________________
	Hi there! I'm Lennox - your personal chatbot
	What can I do for you today?
	* Enter 1 for Echo mode.
 	* Enter 2 for Task mode.
```

The chatbot can be operated in 2 different modes:-
* _**ECHO mode**_ (Option '1' in startup menu): 
  * Type in your messages or task description for chatbot to display them back to you.
  * Acts as temporary post-it sticky notes for you to complete message/task actions soon.
  * Post-it notes keyed in ECHO mode are not stored by program when exiting.


* _**TASK mode**_ (Option '2' in startup menu):
  * Register todo, event, and deadline tasks.
  * More powerful compared to ECHO mode. Allows you to mark tasks as done or remove them from database.
  * Tasks are stored locally when exiting and are loaded back into program when relaunching.

## Usage
