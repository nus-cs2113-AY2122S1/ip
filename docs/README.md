## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<br />

**Q:** How do I transfer my tasks to another Computer?

**A:** Follow the steps in **Quick Start** to setup Duke on the 
other computer and paste the duketasks.txt file in the home
directory of the jar file. All the tasks should now be visible
in Duke.

<br />

**Q:** Why am I unable to add dates in another format?

**A:** We use the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` to ensure 
consistency and ease of use for everybody, hence any 
other format is currently not supported.
