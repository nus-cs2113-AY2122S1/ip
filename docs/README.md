## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
_**Q**: How do I save my tasks?_

**A**: No need to worry about that!  All tasks are automatically saved onto your computer everytime the list is modified. 
_Dude_ will then reload your data the next time you start it.

_**Q**: Can I edit my tasks directly without starting the application?_

**A**: Sure! The text file containing the data can be found at `/data/dude.txt` and can be directly edited using a text file editor. 
Each new task should be written on a new line. Note that you will need to strictly follow the format of previously stored data, 
else _Dude_ will be unable to load that line of data into your task list.
