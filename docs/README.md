# Project Sassy Duke

Project Duke is a educational software project designed to take the user through the steps of building a small software incrementally, while applying as many Java and SE techniques as possible along the way.

The project aims to build a product named Duke, a Personal Assistant Chatbot that helps a person to keep track of various things. The name Duke was chosen as a placeholder name, in honor of Duke, the Java Mascot.

I have modified Duke to have a sassy attitude. Try not to make any errors as he may be merciless in his teasing!

Here is a table containing the command words and a brief description:

*Psssstttttt click commands to skip sections!*

Command | Brief description of command
------------ | -------------
[**todo**](#todo-command) | adds a task to be completed
[**event**](#event-command) | adds an event + location 
[**deadline**](#deadline-command) | adds a deadline + date + time
[**list**](#list-command) | prints the list of all commitments
[**find**](#find-command) | filters commitments by a keyword and prints them
[**delete**](#delete-command) | remove a task from the list
[**done**](#done-command) | mark a task as completed
[**bye**](#close-duke-command) | close and bids Duke *Au Revoir*

On startup, the user will be greeted by the following message:
