## Introducing DUKE CS2113T
Hello there ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to **Duke**! **Duke** is a Task List designed to store various type of 
task like todo, event and deadline which can be displayed to the user.  

## Getting Started
- Download the [JAR file](https://github.com/YEOWEIHNGWHYELAB/ip/releases/download/A-Release/IndividualProject.jar).
- Ensure that you switch your jdk to java 11 first on your terminal.
- Please add an exception to the directory of your JAR on your anti-virus. 
- The "text-art" folder can be created by extracting the [compressed folder](https://github.com/YEOWEIHNGWHYELAB/ip/releases/download/A-Release/text-art.zip) 
that contains all the text-art that needs to be included in the JAR directory 
(all text file in text-art folder must be of depth 1 from JAR base directory). It can also 
be manually downloaded from [text-art](https://github.com/YEOWEIHNGWHYELAB/ip/tree/master/text-art). 
- data/duke.txt will be created in the JAR directory if it does not exist and the duke.txt must 
be kept empty (unless it is of the correct format - generated from this app).
- Run the command ```java -jar IndividualProject.jar``` at the JAR directory.

## Welcome Screen

3 welcome text art will be shown in sequence (as shown below). These Text can
be changed by editing the text-art content through the use of a text-editor.
