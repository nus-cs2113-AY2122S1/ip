## Storage of data

1. A folder named "data" containing a file named "duke.txt" is automatically created if no existing one is detected in the folder you store **ip.jar** upon running Duke. This file is to store your task list.
2. Existing task list will be displayed if you have the "duke.txt" file upon running the app.
3. All changes are automatically saved after any command that makes any change.  
  
*Important:* Do not change anything of the "data" folder or "duke.txt" file in case you lose your existing task list.  
  
Example:  
* "duke.txt" first created:  
```
Folder created for storing task list
duke.txt created inside data folder for storing task list
Reading your List......
____________________________________________________________
```
* "duke.txt" already created:  
```
Nice! You already have a folder for storing task list
Nice! You already have a file inside data folder for storing task list
Reading your List......

2.[E][ ] return book (at: Wed 6pm after lecture)
```
