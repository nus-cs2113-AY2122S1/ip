## FAQ

**Q:** Why am I unable to create a task in the past?

**A:** The tasks are generally scheduled for the future, thus Duke does not allow users to schedule a task for a past
date.
<br />

**Q:** How can I delete multiple tasks or mark multiple tasks as done in one command?

**A:** Deleting multiple tasks and marking multiple tasks as done in one single command is currently unsupported, but an
alternative option is to delete/mark the tasks as done one by one.
<br />

**Q:** How do I transfer my data to another PC?

**A:** Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data from your previous Duke home folder.
