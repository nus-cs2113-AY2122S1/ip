A Deadline task contains a task description and the timestamp that indicate when the task needs to be done by.

Format: `deadline <Task Description> /by <Timestamp>`

> üí° `<Timestamp>` needs to be in the format of `yyyy-MM-dd <Time>` or `dd/MM/yyyy <Time>`. If no `<Time>` is supplied, it will be assumed to be `0000`.

### Save the data to a save file

The tasks in `taskmon`'s memory are automatically saved to a save file `[JAR_LOCATION]/data/duke.txt` after the execution of every command.

### Edit the save file

Advanced users are able to update the tasks directly by editing the save file.

> ‚ùó Note that if the save file is detected to be corrupted or does not conform to `taskmon`'s save file format, it will still run without loading from it.

## FAQ

---

**Question**: What happens if there is no save file in the directory?  
**Answer**: `taskmon` will start from a clean slate and will automatically create one after running the first command.

**Question**: How can I share my save file to another computer?  
**Answer**:  Install `taskmon` on that computer and place the save file at `[JAR_LOCATION]/data/duke.txt` before running `taskmon`.
