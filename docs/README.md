## Saving data to file

### Automatic saving

The tasks in the task list will automatically be saved to a file `data/tasks.txt` in the current directory after every add, delete and done command.

### Editing the save file

The save file `tasks.txt` can be editted such that task information inside the file will be uploaded to the program on its next run.

Each line represents a single task and the `,` character is used to seperate the task information.

The save file saves tasks in the following formats:

```
<type>,<completion_status>,<description>
<type>,<completion_status>,<description>,<date>
```
> üí° `<type>` **T** for *Todo*, **D** for *Deadline* and **E** for *Event*
> 
> üí° `<completion_status>` must be either `1` for compete or `0` for incompleted.
> 
> üí° `<description>` must not have `,`
>
