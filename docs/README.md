# User Guide

Duke is a **desktop app for managing tasks**, optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**.
There is no Graphical Interface (GUI), but the program will work better than traditional apps if you can type fast.

## Features

### Notes about command format:
1. Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user. <br />
e.g. in `todo DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `todo read book`

2. Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `bye` and `clear`) will be ignored.
e.g. if the command specifies `help lmao`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
