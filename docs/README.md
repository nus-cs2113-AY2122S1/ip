# Duke User Guide

Duke is a **desktop app for managing tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)**. It is especially
efficient if you can type fast, and can be even faster than traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
task managing apps.

---

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have `Java 11` or above installed in your computer.
2. Download the latest `Duke.jar` from [here](https://github.com/BryanElmer/ip/releases/download/A-Release/Duke.jar).
3. Copy the jar file to the folder where you want to run Duke in.
4. Open your terminal app and make sure that you are in the same working directory as your duke file.
5. At the folder where you saved the jar file, run the command `java -jar Duke.jar` in your terminal app.
6. In the case where Duke runs successfully, you should see the following output.

```
    ____        _        
   |  _ \ _   _| | _____ 
   | | | | | | | |/ / _ \
   | |_| | |_| |   <  __/
   |____/ \__,_|_|\_\___|
    ____________________________________________________________
        Hello! I'm Duke
        What can I do for you?
    ____________________________________________________________
```

7. Type your command in the blank line under the horizontal separator and press Enter to execute.  
    (Ex. typing `list` and pressing Enter will display your current task list.)
8. Refer to the features section below for details on each command.

## Features

### Notes about the command format:
- Words in `UPPER-CASE` are parameters to be filled by the user. Here is a list of common parameters that will be used:
    - `TASK_NAME` represents the name of the task.
    - `DATE_TIME` represents the date and time to be specified by the user.
      - This parameter has to be in this format: `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm`.
      - For example: `2021-10-01 16:35` which is equivalent to `10 Oct 2021 16:35`.
    - `INDEX` represents the index of the task in the task list.  
        - For example: index **1** corresponds to the **first task** in the task list, 
          index **3** corresponds to the **third task**.
    - `KEYWORD` represents the keyword to be specified by the user.
    - `TASK_TYPE_CHAR` represents the type of task.
        - `T` represents a `Todo` task.
        - `D` represents a `Deadline` task.
        - `E` represents an `Event` task.
    - `STATUS_MARKER_INT` represents the completion status of the task in the data text file.
        - `0` represents an **undone** task.
        - `1` represents a **done** task.
- Items with `...` after them can be used more than once.
    - For example: `done INDEX...` means `done 1 2 3` is a valid command.

## Saving the data
Duke saves all the task data into a text file automatically after any command performed.  
There is no need to save data manually.

---

## Editing the data text file
Duke saves the task data into a text file `JAR_FILE_LOCATION/data/savedTasks.txt`. Although not recommended, you can
manually change the data in the text file.  

Be sure to follow this exact formatting:  

```
[TASK_TYPE_CHAR] | [STATUS_MARKER_INT] | TASK_NAME | DATE_TIME
```

***Note: If Duke is unable to run due to issues with text file, you must delete the data text file manually.***
