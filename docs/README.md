# User Guide

## Features 

### Work with multiple task types
Keep track of todo items, events and deadlines using simple commands.

**Todo** tasks only include a description

**Deadline** tasks have a description and a due by date

**Event** tasks have a description and a date at which they occur

#### Task representation by taro:
All tasks stored by taro are displayed using the following representation: `[TASK_TYPE][COMPLETION_STATUS] TASK_DESCRIPTION [DATE]`
- `TASK_TYPE`: either `T`, `D` or `E`, indicating if the task is a Todo, Deadline or Event task respectively
- `COMPLETION_STATUS`: either blank or `X` where a blank space represents an incomplete task and an `X` represents a completed task
- `TASK_DESCRIPTION`: the description of the task specified when adding the task
- `DATE`: only for Deadline and Event type tasks
  - `by` date for Deadline tasks as the date by which the task is due
  - `at` date for Event tasks as the date at which the event occurs

Example: `[D][ ] setup vet appointment (by: tomorrow evening)`

This indicates that the task is a Deadline type task that is incomplete, with the description "setup vet appointment" that is due by "tomorrow evening".

Please refer to this section when interpreting the example outputs found under the "Usage" section of this guide.
