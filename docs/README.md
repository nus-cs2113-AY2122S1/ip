Q: Are the commands case-sensitive?

A: Yes, please follow the specified casing. All commands are in lower-case. However, your task descriptions can be in any case.

Q: How do I transfer my list of tasks and all associated data to another computer?

A: Transfer the text file named "Tasks.txt", located in the same directory as your iP.jar file over 
to your other computer. Place it in the same directory as the iP.jar file on your other computer. Your 
tasks will then be loaded from this text file when you run iP.jar on your new computer.
