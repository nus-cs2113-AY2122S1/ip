### 2.8 Saving the data
For first time users, a default folder `data` is created upon running the Duke program. 
A text file `duke.txt` is also generated in the `data` folder to serve as the local storage
to store the user's task data.

> **Note**: The `data` folder is created in the same directory as `Duke_A0217143N.jar`.

The user's tasklist data are saved to `duke.txt` automatically after any command
that modifies the tasklist. e.g. adding a task, deleting a task, marking a task as done.

There is no need to manually save the data.

## 3. FAQ
**Q:** How do I transfer my data to another computer?

**A:** Install the program on the other computer and replace the new empty `duke.txt`
it creates with the `duke.txt` that you wish to transfer from your previous `Duke.jar`
home folder.
