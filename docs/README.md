# User Guide
This is a user guide to Gavien's CS2113T Duke Program.
## Features 
Duke is a task manager which is able to
1. Add new tasks.
2. List all existing tasks in chronological order.
3. Set a task a done.
4. Delete existing tasks.
5. Find all tasks that contain a specific word or words.

### Feature - Add tasks
Duke is able to add 3 different tasks types.
To add tasks, you will need to follow the specific formatting of inputs as show in *italics*.

ToDo tasks - ToDo tasks are simple tasks that only have a description - *todo 'description'*

Deadline tasks - Deadline tasks are tasks with a specific deadline - *deadline 'description' /by 'deadline'*

Event tasks - Event tasks are tasks with a specific duration - *event 'description' /at 'duration'*

### Feature - List all tasks
Duke is able to list all existing tasks by chronological order that you have added them.

To list the tasks, the format is *list*.

Duke will then show you the tasks, including its index, type, done status, description and deadline/duration (if applicable) in this specific order.

### Feature - Set a task as done
Tasks will contain a status to show if they are done(X) or not( ).

To set a task as done, the format is *done 'task index'*.

You can find the task index by listing all tasks with *list*.

### Feature - Delete a task
Tasks can be deleted from the existing list.

To delete a task, the format is *delete 'task index'*.

You can find the task index by listing all tasks with *list*.

### Feature - Find tasks
You can find specific tasks by specifying a certain word or words.

Tasks that contain that word/words will then be listed.

To find specific tasks, the format is *find 'specific word/words'*.

Duke will then show you a list with the same format as listing all tasks.

### Feature - Save functionality
You are able to save your existing list of tasks when you exit Duke.

Your list will be saved in a text file **input.txt**.

Do not edit this text file as Duke is only able to read certain characters from the save file.

### Exit Duke
You can exit Duke by typing in *bye*.

Duke will then exit and save your existing list in the save file.
