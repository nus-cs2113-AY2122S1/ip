# User Guide

Duke is an application for users to manage and track Tasks via a Command Line Interface (CLI). It is useful for users that wish to have an organized and consolidated view of list of things that they plan to do. Duke presents tasks in sorted order allowing users to prioritise tasks with more urgency. Duke is also built with data persistence, meaning data is stored such that information is not lost between sessions.
