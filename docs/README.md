# User Guide
Duke is a text-based app for people to manage their recent tasks. It works like a memory keeper to record users' deadlines, events, todos and their completion statuses.
***
## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` installed in your computer.
2. Download the latest `duke.jar` from [here](https://github.com/LilyDaytoy/ip/releases/tag/A-Release).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as your *home folder* for Duke.
4. Open your Command Line Terminal in the folder where `duke.jar` is located and run Duke using `java -jar duke.jar`.
5. Type the command in the Terminal and press Enter to execute it. For example, type `list` and press Enter will show you all the current tasks you have and their corresponding completion statuses.
   Here are some example commands you can try:
    * `list` List all the current tasks and their completion statuses
    * `find book` Find the tasks including the keyword "book"
    * `done 2` Mark the second task as done
    * `todo quiz` Add the quiz task as a todo task
    * `bye` Exit the app and Duke will save your records automatically for you
6. Look at the **Features** below to get more details about each command.

## Features

### Notes

#### Notes about command format:
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. e.g. the `TASK_INDEX` in `done TASK_INDEX` is a parameter that user should provide, such as `done 1`.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken. e.g. if you specified `/by 5pm /by 9pm` then it will be recognized as `/by "5pm /by 9pm"` and display the result as `(by:5pm /by 9pm)`.

#### Notes about the Tasks in Duke:
* There are 3 types of tasks in Duke: `todo`, `deadline`, `event`.
  * These three types are distinguished by how user inputs the `TIME` parameter.
  * `TIME` parameter in Duke will only be recognized as a string with no actual time meaning, any format of time you want to record will be ok.
* Here are what the 3 types of Tasks represent:
  * `todo`: a task you need to do with no `TIME` parameter specified.
  * `deadline`: a task you need to complete before the deadline, which is the `TIME` parameter you provide.
  * `event`: a task you need to do during a specific time, which is the `TIME` parameter given by the user.
* The 3 types of tasks are stored in Duke as examples below:
  * `todo`: `[T][] myTodo`
  * `deadline`: `[D][] myDeadline (by : deadline time)`
  * `event`: `[E][] myEveny (at: event time)`
