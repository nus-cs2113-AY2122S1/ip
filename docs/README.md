**The Marauder's Map** is a CLI (Command Line Interface) task manager that (somewhat) assists you in manageing your tasks. 
Follow this User Guide to learn the map's charms. 

## Quick Start 
To set up Java Environment: Install the lastest Version of Java 11.
1. Download the latest release of THE MARAUDER'S MAP [here](https://github.com/Isabella-L/ip/releases/latest).
2. Navigate to the folder that contains the Jar file.
3. Run `java -jar -ip.jar`
4. If there is no error, the map should ask you for a Revealing Charm:

   If you are a muggle(i.e. dont know the charm), you will be forever trapped here and watch the map brutally insults its nemesis. 
5. Once the correct charm is entered, the map is at your service.

### Saving tasks 
The map automatically saves task data into the file everytime the list is modified. Your tasks will still be retained after you exit the program. In the same folder as your JAR file, there will be a data folder which contains 'duke.txt' that stores all your tasks.

### Loading data
Everytime the map activates, it will look for the 'duke.txt' file and load the tasks inside. If there is no such file, the program will automatically creates one.

You can exit the Map through the `bye` command 
- E.g. `bye`
