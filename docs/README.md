### Save data to file

Unker will save all the tasks you gave him to a file in the folder under `data/unker.csv` together with your JAR file. You may change the contents inside the file as you wish when the program is not running.

The data is stored in a CSV format: `<task type>,<is done>,<description>`

> ❗ **Caution**:  
> If there is a **syntax or parsing error** in any line in the save file, Unker will **silently ignore** the line, and may even **delete** it if any changes are made to the file.
> 
> If you **change the file** as the program is **running**, your changes will be **overridden** by the program when the program exits or updates the file.
