# User Guide

Project Kate is a **desktop application for recording different types of tasks**, 
optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while having benefits of
a Graphic User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Kate is able
to record down your various tasks faster than traditional GUI applications.
