Hello! I'm Duke
I am currently able to help you keep track of tasks
scheduled to receive a personality soon, exciting!
Type "help" to find out what I can do for you.
========================================================================
I currently support 3 types of tasks: todo, deadline and event
To add a todo task: todo task name
To add a deadline task: deadline task name /by yyyy-mm-dd xx:xx where xx:xx is the time
To add an event task: event task name /at yyyy-mm-dd xx:xx where xx:xx is the time
To delete a task in the list: delete x where x is the entry number
To see your current list, use the command "list"
To cross out an entry, use the command "done x" where x is the entry number
To see all tasks of a certain date, use the command "date yyyy-mm-dd"
When you're done, type "bye" to end the program (automatically saves your current list)
========================================================================
I've added the following task:
[T][ ] task 1
========================================================================
I've added the following task:
[D][ ] task 2 (by: Dec 9 2020 12:0 )
========================================================================
I've added the following task:
[E][ ] task 3 (at: Dec 12 2021 9:30 )
========================================================================
Here is your current list
1.[T][ ] task 1
2.[D][ ] task 2 (by: Dec 9 2020 12:0 )
3.[E][ ] task 3 (at: Dec 12 2021 9:30 )
You have 3 task(s) on your list.
========================================================================
task 1 done. Well done.
========================================================================
task 2 done. Well done.
========================================================================
task 3 done. Well done.
========================================================================
I've deleted the following entry
[T][X] task 1
========================================================================
the done command is of the form "done x" where x is an entry number
========================================================================
That entry number does not exist in your list
========================================================================
I've deleted the following entry
[D][X] task 2 (by: Dec 9 2020 12:0 )
========================================================================
I've deleted the following entry
[E][X] task 3 (at: Dec 12 2021 9:30 )
========================================================================
Bye! See you soon!
